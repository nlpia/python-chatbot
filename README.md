Python Chatbot
==============

A simple, extensible bot for your IRC channels.

Installation
------------

With Pip:

```bash
sudo pip install git+https://github.com/harrislapiroff/python-chatbot.git@master#egg=chatbot
```

Usage
-----

To run a bot, you must write a short python script. For example `simple_bot.py`:

```python
from chatbot.bots import Bot
from chatbot.contrib import *

bot = Bot(
    nickname = 'bestbot',
    hostname = 'chat.freenode.net',
    port = 6665,
    server_password = 'my_bots_password',
    channels = ('#freenode', '#python'),
    features = (
        PyPIFeature(),
        WikipediaFeature(),
        DictionaryFeature(),
        DiceFeature(),
        ChoiceFeature(),
        SlapbackFeature(),
    )
)

bot.run()
```

Then run the script:

```bash
python simple_bot.py
```

The Flexible `Match` Feature
----------------------------

**Chatbot** comes with a built in `Match` feature, which is both simple and
powerful. You can build an entire bot from `Match` features alone. Here is an
example of a simple bot that will slap people on command.

```python
from chatbot.bots import Bot
from chatbot.contrib.simple import Match
from chatbot.chat import ChatResponse

SLAP_OPTIONS = (
    ChatResponse('slaps \g<target> around a bit with a baseball bat', action=True),
    ChatResponse('slaps \g<target> around a bit with a large trout', action=True),
    ChatResponse('slaps \g<target> around a bit with a piano', action=True),
    ChatResponse('slaps \g<target> around a bit with a french fry', action=True),
)

bot = Bot(
    nickname = 'bestbot',
    hostname = 'chat.freenode.net',
    port = 6665,
    server_password = 'my_bots_password',
    channels = ('#freenode', '#python'),
    features = (
        Match(r'slap (?P<target>[^\s]+) (?P<object>.+)', ChatResponse('slaps \g<target> around a bit \g<object>', action=True), addressing_required=True, allow_continuation=False),
        Match(r'slap (?P<target>.+)', SLAP_OPTIONS, addressing_required=True, allow_continuation=False),
    )
)

bot.run()
```

In this case, the bot handles two possible matches. The first pattern matches sentences such as `bestbot: slap melinath with a frying pan` by responding with an action, `slaps melinath around a bit with a frying pan`. The second pattern matches commands to slap that do not specify the method of slapping (e.g., `slap melinath`), by choosing an option randomly from `SLAP_OPTIONS` (e.g., `slaps melinath around a bit with a french fry`).
